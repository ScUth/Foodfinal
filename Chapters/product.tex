\section{Dried straw mushrooms}
\subsection{How to make}
The steps involved are as follows: first, select unopened straw mushrooms, then remove the stem and cut each mushroom in half using a bamboo knife. Next, bake the halves in an oast house at a temperature of 50-70Â°C for 35-45 minutes. After removing them from the oast house, place the mushrooms in a cool, moist area for 3-5 minutes. Finally, return the mushrooms to the oast house until they are completely dry. This drying method helps preserve the original flavor of fresh straw mushrooms and makes them easy to store.
