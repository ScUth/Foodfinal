Eating straw mushrooms has some very uncommon side effects. The species has a small chance of causing fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, which could lead to severe consequences such as brain abscesses.\par

Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to straw mushrooms. Symptoms can range from mild, such as skin rashes and itching, to severe, including difficulty breathing and anaphylaxis. Those trying these mushrooms for the first time should proceed cautiously.\par

Straw mushrooms are highly perishable. They have a short shelf life and require proper storage to avoid spoilage. Improper handling can lead to bacterial growth, which may cause food poisoning if consumed.
\medbreak
Canned or processed straw mushrooms often lose some of their nutritional value due to heat and chemical treatments. Additionally, preservatives added during processing may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with sensitivities or health concerns.\par

Fresh straw mushrooms can be expensive, particularly in regions where they are not cultivated locally. Import costs and their delicate nature contribute to their high price, making them less accessible to some consumers.\par

Commercial cultivation of straw mushrooms can have environmental implications. The use of pesticides, fertilizers, and water-intensive farming methods may contribute to soil degradation, water pollution, and resource depletion.

Common insect pests of straw mushrooms include phorids and mites. Nematodes can also cause crop losses.
