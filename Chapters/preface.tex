{\fontsize{16pt}{16pt}\normalfont $\quad$ This report on straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea) reflects our group's shared passion for exploring sustainable food sources. In addition to delving into their history, nutritional value, and cultivation methods, we also consider their potential as a sustainable food option. Straw mushrooms, known for their ability to grow on agricultural by products, offer an eco-friendly and resource-efficient solution for meeting global food demands.
